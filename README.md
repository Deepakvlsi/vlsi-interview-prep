### Carry Look Ahead Adder ###
Carry propagation delay occurs in adders during operations like multiplication and division, which involve multiple additions. In ripple carry adders, each bit must wait for the previous carry, causing delay. To overcome this, the Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA) precomputes carry signals using input bits, significantly reducing delay and speeding up arithmetic operations.
